#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because the time increases based on the size of a

b) O(n^2) because there are 2 loops

c) O(n) because the time increases based on the number of bunnies

## Exercise II

This problem seems similar to the looking for a name in the phonebook example that we had during lecture. I would do the same type of binary search as that example, which would give it a runtime of O(log n). This means the length of time grows proportional to the growth of items to be searched.

We would split the building in half and drop an egg. If it doesn't break we repeat the process of splitting the floors but go with the half that is higher. If the egg does break then we would split the lower half of floors. Repeat the process until we find floor f.
